## First, Some Definitions

_Voice_ be how we talk to ye scallywags. It’s shaped by things like tone, style, personality, and substance and be almost always consistent across all kinds o' content. We have voice traits that we aspire to: honest, empowerin', and ingenious. [Here’s](#voice-strategies) where ye can learn more 'bout how we write that voice.

 _Tone_ be the mood or atmosphere that’s created. Ye shift yer tone dependin' on whether ye’re scribin' somethin' serious, like security information, versus introducin' a new feature that ye want to encourage users to try out.

 Regardless o' the tone ye use, always keep that honest, empowerin', and ingenious voice in yer sights. These guidelines can help.

## Why Voice and Tone Matter

Voice and tone enhance our relationship with customers. We want readers to feel like they’re learnin' from a really smart matey. Not the show-offy kind, but the kind who really wants ye to get it and is great at explainin' things. That way, our content becomes:

* Honest, empowerin', and ingenious
* A pleasure to read and use
* Accessible for busy buccaneers

## Know Yer Audience

Through our docs, we’re constantly takin' into account our DevOps audience. We design information to help these readers learn and solve problems. Attention to voice, particularly voice that appeals to developers, ensures that they want to keep readin'.

Who they be: obviously, every pirate be different. In general, developers want tools that work and info that’s delivered quickly and then gets out o' the way. And some fizzy water. They like fizzy water.

Writin' for developers means:

* Clean, clear, human writin'
* Content that’s short and on topic
* A light seasonin' o' developer-y jargon is good (make sure context keeps things clear)
* No corporate speak or blarney
* Droppin' in some interestin' verbs - futz or grok, for example

## Strategies for Bein' Honest, Empowerin', and Ingenious [#voice-strategies]

Here’s a quick guide to writin' our voice traits:

Consider readin' aloud to hear how yer content sounds. Is it natural? Are the sentences punchy and encouragin'? Great! Then think about how ye can bring in some other strategies as well.

## Get Creative

To take things a step further, consider pushin' the voice. Add an analogy or metaphor. Metaphors be helpful for explainin' complex ideas and the data shows that engineers use them a lot. Get a little creative with language. Inject a use case with a little more detail. Ye can even humble brag about New Relic products in a way that’s fun and obviously tongue in cheek. If ye’re workin' with an SME, enlist their help in comin' up with particularly apt analogies.

Intros and overview pages be a great place for pushin' voice a little more:

* Readers be in the right mindset for somethin' a little unusual (unusual for tech writin' that be—we’re not sayin' go full James Joyce or Doctor Suess here). These readers be lookin' to learn about a product or feature, rather than solve an urgent problem.
* These be sometimes the reader's first impressions o' the docs and the products. If they’re engaged, they’re likely to keep readin', and will get to know our products better.
* A little goes a long way. One or two voice-y sentences at the top o' the page sets the tone, even if the rest o' the page be strictly business.

### Examples

## What Not to Do [#dont-do]

While there be lots o' things to do to achieve the New Relic voice, there be a few things to avoid as well:

* **Don’t be pointless**. Inject some fun or creativity, but don’t waste the reader’s time. An extended metaphor or a lengthy story 'bout the user’s favorite taco stand can quickly try their patience. We’re talkin' brushstrokes, not paragraphs.
* **Don’t push too hard**. Check in on what feels natural and comfortable. If ye feel awkward scribin' it, yer content will likely read as pretty awkward as well.
